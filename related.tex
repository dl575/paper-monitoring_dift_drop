% Filtering
Hardbound filters out non-pointer data \cite{hardbound-asplos08}. FlexiTaint filters out some monitoring
and performs it in hardware. FADE \cite{fade-hpca14} provides a more general filtering engine. It
filters out redundant updates and clean checks by reading metadata values. Our
dataflow engine does not require reading the actual metadata values which may
be large. We do not handle filtering redundant updates, but we do filter out
clean checks as well as clean (i.e., uninitialized) propagations. We are able
to do this because the dataflow engine can also propagate the uninitialized
information. In addition, our dataflow engine can be used to provide adjustable
overheads without false positives which is not a capability described by FADE.
