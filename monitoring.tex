\subsection{Overhead of Run-Time Monitoring}

There have been a number of proposals for run-time monitoring systems exploring various
design points. % in the trade-off space between efficiency and flexibility.
Table~\ref{tab:monitoring.previous_overheads} summarizes some of representative designs
and their reported performance overhead. The previous studies clearly show that there
exist trade-offs among efficiency, flexibility, and hardware costs. 
For example, a run-time monitoring scheme can often be realized with fairly low
performance overhead (less than 20\%) if implemented with custom hardware that is
designed only for one monitor or a narrow set of monitors. However, the custom
hardware monitors cannot be modified or updated, and require dedicated silicon area. 
One the other hand, flexible systems that support a wide range of monitors lead 
to noticeable performance overhead, often too high for wide deployment in practice.
Software-only implementations \cite{FIXME} or multi-core monitors with minimal
hardware changes \cite{lba-asid06} are reported to have severalfold slowdowns.
On-chip FPGA monitors \cite{flexcore-micro10} and cores with monitoring accelerators
\cite{lba-isca08, fade-hpca14} can reduce overhead significantly, but still show
slowdowns of several tens of percents in some cases.


\subsection{Partial Monitoring for Adjustable Overhead}

In this paper, we investigate adding a new dimension to the trade-off space of 
run-time monitors by allowing coverage or accuracy of a monitor to be traded
off for lower performance and/or hardware overhead.

namely coverage/accuracy of monitors.


will focus our discussion on using a parallel
processing core to implement the monitor. Our evaluation includes results
for both the core-based monitor as well as a higher performance FPGA-based monitor.

Benefits - low overhead or simpler HW

\subsection{Applications and Metrics}

Three main app
- Partial protection for run-time attacks or bugs: you care about the dynamic coverage 
- Soft real-time systems: tight deadline required
- Sampling for Profiling: target metric - accuracy

\subsection{Challenges}

There were three main challenges in designing this dropping hardware:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{General:} The hardware needs to be applicable to a wide range of monitoring schemes.
  \item \textbf{No false positives:} False positives should never occur as a result of dropping.
  \item \textbf{Intelligent dropping:} The hardware needs to maximize the amount of useful monitoring done while staying within the overhead budget.
\end{enumerate}
